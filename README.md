# VKBot
Bot for VK groups
# Requerements
Firstly, you need to install NodeJS to your server or PC,

You can download it from here: https://nodejs.org/en/

If you are a Linux user, the installation guide is here: https://pacmard.ru/nodejs/guide

Bot will correctly work ONLY WITH GROUP OAUTH KEY! You can get it in the settings of your group.
Key needs all permissions. 

Place key in these vars:

let t1ken = 'enter your token here';

vk = new VK('enter your token here'); (maybee will be deleted soon as well)

# Commands

TBD.

Soon I plan to start a sprint, so list of commands will be expanded
